### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an IT Professional in the CI/CD DevOps space related to Containers, Kubernetes, and GitOps. I strive to make things simple, easy, and user-friendly for my customers and colleagues. I mainly do this by documenting my findings, procedures, and tips so others can understand what's going on and save time. I am also the documentation guy on my team because I have revamped and contributed to internal and external documentation.

Currently, I am advancing my knowledge about Kubernetes, Argo Project, and containers in general. To achieve this, I have started learning and achieving Cloud Native Computing Foundation certifications for Kubernetes. I have applied my knowledge from learning Kubernetes with Argo Project to create CI/CD Pipelines and deploy simple applications.

Above are items I am working towards professionally, but I am usually not that technical when off the clock. I prefer not to look at a screen after work and be outside. I have a TV, but it is rarely on unless others are over. So what do I do after work if not in front of a screen? I like to travel and explore new places, go hiking, visit a new national/state park, try a new restaurant, or see an everyday spot.
